EcoFinds sustainable second hand market place!!!!!!!!
Develop a foundational version of EcoFinds, focusing on core user authentication and
product listing functionalities. Teams must deliver a functional prototype, accessible via
both mobile and desktop interfaces, that allows users to register and log in, create and
manage basic product listings (including title, description, category, price, and at least
one image placeholder), and browse these listings with basic filtering and search
capabilities. The system must employ efficient data structures for managing user and
product data, ensuring a stable and responsive user experience.
