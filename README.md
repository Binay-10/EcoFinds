#  EcoFinds – Buy, Sell & Reuse Sustainably

**EcoFinds** is a modern, eco-inspired classified ads platform built with **React.js** and **Firebase**, designed to promote sustainable living through **reuse, recycling, and responsible consumption**.  
It allows users to easily **buy, sell, and give away used items** in their local community — making sustainability both simple and social.

##  Project Vision
Every year, millions of usable items are discarded simply because there’s no easy way to pass them on.  
**EcoFinds** aims to change that by creating a **digital marketplace** where people can:
- Reduce waste 
- Save money   
- Encourage reuse and sustainability  

This project was created as part of my learning journey in **web development** and **cloud computing**, integrating **React**, **Firebase**, and **AI-powered features** for a smarter, cleaner future.
